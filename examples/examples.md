# Examples
Various examples for using Firefly. 

More examples are coming soon. In the meantime, consider checking the [crates.io documentation](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_firefly/0.1.1) to learn about implementing certain advanced features. 

## Simple 
Simple example of integrating firefly into your bevy app and spawning a light and some round occluders. You can move the light using the arrow keys.

## Stress
A stress test for firefly. It spawns a large amount of lights and occluders. You can press the left and right arrows to zoom in an out. 
This shouldn't be used as an example on using firefly, it's simply used to test the performance impact of new features and optimizations.

Includes a performance meter.
