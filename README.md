# firefly

Firefly is an open-source, **2d lighting** crate for the [bevy game engine](https://bevy.org/).

## Goals 
The goal of firefly is to have a **fully 2d** lighting crate with features akin to the ones of more mature game engines, while 
keeping performance as high as possible and the minimizing the end-user API. 

## State 
Firefly is still pretty early in development, with many features to be added still. However, there are already lot of cool stuff for you to play with 
or use for your games, if you wish to.

Some of the existing features are: 
  - Soft shadows
  - Round and polygonal occluders
  - Occlusion z-sorting
  - Occlusion sprite masking 
  - Light banding

Some of the currently planned features are: 
  - Normal maps
